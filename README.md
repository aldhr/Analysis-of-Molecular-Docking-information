# Analysis-of-Molecular-Docking-information
Analysis of a 80 ligands set chemical structure and their interactions with proteins' residues.

I have make some ipynb to anlayse a set of 80 drugs and its interactions with target (with PLIP server). 
This codes incorporates: 
1 - Dice Similarity Coefficient 80x80 Matrix calculation. 
2 - Transformation of data into corralation Matrix. 
3 - Calculations and plotting of Molecular Descriptors.  
4 - Analysis of which interactions with protein are more relevant of the set of study.
